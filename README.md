### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Mwaka, a full stack developer based in Kampala Uganda. I created [TheOne app](https://theoneapp.rocks) and it's the thing that mostly takes up my evenings.
Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Tensorflow while working on a model to filter out and reject inappropriate profile photos on [TheOne app](https://theoneapp.rocks)
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on A.I projects that are solving africas biggest challenges.

You can get me on twitter [@wodaceng](https://twitter.com/@wodaceng). I am available for freelance projects and would love to work on some interesting things with awesome people. Ping me!
